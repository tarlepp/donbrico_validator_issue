Someone asked how to validate `nullable boolean` value on Symfony slack,
so I created this simple repository to show how that can be done

## How to test this?

1. Clone repository
1. Run `composer install`
1. Run `symfony serve`
1. Open application on your browser
1. You should see validator error
1. Profit
